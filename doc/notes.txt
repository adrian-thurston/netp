Assumptions
===========

1. The ratio of ( readers + writers ) to number of blocks is very small.

Rules:

1. If there are multiple writers contributing to a single ring they should
  not be interrputable, nor can they reserve blocks and wait. If they start
  to write they must finish so that the writers do not get far apart from
  each other. 


Multiple Writers
================

To allow multiple writers into a ring?

Can only work when there is no reserve required (not hardware rings).

Can only work when writers cannot be interrputed.

Non-direct-access kernel only (least desirable setup) .. so optimizing the
thing we don't want to use.

SIMD instructions can be used to optimze 

Using a ring per writer wastes memory, but we need to do this anyways for hardware rings.

Maybe look to other ways to reduce memory consuption ... such as
adaptable-size rings. Or disconnect descriptors from pages in some mapping.
